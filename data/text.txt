n the context of data processing with Apache Spark, "full load" and "incremental load" refer to two different strategies for managing and processing data.

Full Load:

Definition: Full load, also known as a full refresh, involves loading the entire dataset from the source to the target destination.
Use Case: Full load is typically used when you want to replace the entire contents of the target dataset with the latest data from the source. It is suitable for scenarios where the dataset is not too large, and you want to ensure that the target reflects the most up-to-date information.
Incremental Load:

Definition: Incremental load involves loading only the new or modified data since the last update, rather than reloading the entire dataset.
Use Case: Incremental load is used when dealing with large datasets, and it is impractical to reload the entire dataset every time. It helps optimize performance and reduces the amount of data transferred, improving efficiency in scenarios where only a subset of the data changes regularly.
